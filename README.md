# What is Jumbler?

Jumbler can password encrypt and decrypt a large number of file names.  
Because it only encrypts the file names, not their content, it is really fast!

If you have files that you want to protect but data encryption is not an option (too slow, limited permission).

Using Jumbler prevents any exposure of information through directory listing.
